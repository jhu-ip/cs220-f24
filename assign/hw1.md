### Overview

In this homework, you will write a program to help the user keep track of
a collection of coins of arbitrary denominations.

### Program Requirements

When the program starts, it prompts the user to enter the number
of different coin denominations that will be used ("`How many denominations?`"). Then,
for each coin denomination, it prompts the user for a one-letter identifier
and the value of the coin ("`Enter coin identifier and value in cents:`").
Note that the coin identifiers are case-sensitive, so "`d`" and "`D`" are
different identifiers.  Also note that the value of the coin must be an
integer (i.e., the program should represent coin values as integers.)

Once all of the coin identifiers and values
are recorded, the program enters a command loop. Each time the
program prompts the user to enter a command ("`Enter a command:`"),
the user enters the one-letter name of the command, and if the command
requires additional values to be entered, reads those values. It then
carries out the command and if the command
was not "`q`" (quit), continues the command loop.

There are four commands:

* The `a` command adds to the count of how many coins of a specified
  type are in the user's collection. The `a` command is followed by
  the one-letter identifier of the type of coin to be added, followed by
  the integer count of how many of that type of coin should be added to
  the collection. For example `a p 11` would add 11 of the type of coin
  identified by the letter "`p`" to the collection.
* The `r` command subtracts from the count of how many coins of a specified
  type are in the user's collection. It behaves like the "`a`" command, except
  that the count of the specified type of coin is subtracted from the collection
  rather than added to the collection.
* The `s` command summarizes the user's coin collection. The output is
  formatted as comma-separated values (CSV).  First, a header line with
  the fields "Identifier", "Face Value", "Count", and "Total Value" is
  printed. Then, for each kind of coin (in the order in which they were
  entered at the beginning of the program execution), an output line is
  printed with the coin identifier, coin face value, number of that
  type of coin in the user's collection, and total value of that kind of
  coins in cents. For both the header line and the lines summarizing each
  kind of coin, fields are separated by comma ("`,`") characters, with
  no space before or after each comma. At the end of the summary, a line
  reading "<code class='highlighter-rouge'>Overall value of collection: $<i>X</i>.<i>YY</i></code>"
  is printed, where *X* and *YY* indicate the number of dollars and cents
  in the overall value of the collection.
* The `q` command causes the command loop to terminate.

Note that the user could also terminate the command loop by typing
**ctrl-d** when prompted for a command.

<div class='admonition tip'>
<div class='title'>Tip</div>
<div class='content'>
<p>In some situations, the user will need to press <strong>ctrl-d</strong>
twice in a row in order to generate an end-of-file condition for the
program's standard input.</p>
</div>
</div>

When the command loop terminates, the program prints a line with the
text `Bye!` and then exits with the exit code 0.

### Error Handling

The program should handle errors as follows.

If either

* the user doesn't enter a valid value for the number of coin denominations when prompted, or
* the user doesn't enter a valid identifier and value for a coin denomination when prompted, or
* the user doesn't enter a valid identifier and count after an `a` or `r` command,

then the program should print the line "`Invalid input`" to `stderr` and exit with the
exit code 1.

If the user enters a coin identifier as part of an `a` or `r` command that
is not one of the identifiers entered by the user prior to the command loop,
the program should print the line "`Unknown coin identifier`" to `stderr`
and exit with the exit code 2. Note that the "`Unknown coin identifier`"
should only be printed if the coin identifier and count were both
read successfully.

If the user enters a command character that is not one of `a`, `r`, `s`, or
`q`, then the program should print the line "`Invalid command`" to `stderr`
and exit with the exit code 3.

If no errors occur and the program completes normally, it should exit with the
exit code 0.

Note that all of your code can be in a single `main` function, so a `return`
statement will exit the program. E.g., the statement

```c
return 1;
```

will exit the program with the exit code 1. (In future assignments, we will
expect you to write functions to modularize your program, but you don't need
to use functions for this assignment.)

Note that you do not need to handle the following kinds of errors:

* The user specifies that there are fewer than 1 or more than 20 coin denominations
* The user enters the same coin identifier more than once when entering the
  coin denominations
* The user uses the "`r`" command in a way that would cause the count
  of a particular kind of coin to drop below 0

### Hints and Specifications

The program should allow the user to enter up to 20 coin denominations.
You should use arrays to keep track of the identifiers for each type of
coin and their face values. For example,

```c
char identifiers[MAX_DENOMINATIONS];
int values[MAX_DENOMINATIONS];
```

You'll also want to have a variable indicating how many different types
of coins there are, so that you know which elements of these arrays are
used.

It will also make sense to have an array keeping track of how many coins
of each type are in the user's collection.

Make sure that your program consistently checks the return value of `scanf`
so that it knows whether or not input was read successfully.

Keep in mind that error messages should be printed to `stderr` and not
`stdout`.

### Development Requirements

In the homework folder of your private repository
(`2023-fall-student-JHED`), you should create a new subfolder named
`homework/hw1`. In that `homework/hw1` subfolder, you will create your program in a new
C source file named `coins.c`. At the top of the file, add a comment with
your six character alphanumeric **Hopkins ID**. (Please do not include
your name or JHED so as to allow for blind grading.)

Throughout your work on this assignment, be sure to frequently add, commit
(supplying meaningful messages) and push your changes to your personal
git repository.  After you complete your work on the assignment, you will
be asked to submit a *gitlog.txt* file, just as in [Homework 0](hw0.html). However,
we expect your log for this homework to show more activity.

Recall that your code is always expected to compile without errors
or warnings, on the ugrad servers. Submissions which do not compile
properly may earn zero points, so be sure to submit to Gradescope early
and often! And once you get a good start on the assignment, always have
some earlier compiling version of your work pushed up to Github.

### Example Runs

<div class="admonition caution">
<div class='title'>Caution</div>

<p>
Note that when you test your program in a terminal using the example inputs
shown below, the result should be <em>exactly</em> what is shown below,
including spacing. Note that
<ul>
  <li>Each prompt should end with a space, but should <em>not</em> have a newline at the end</li>
  <li>Each output line in response to the "`s`" and "`q`" commands <em>should</em> end with a newline</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
</div>

Here are several samples runs of the program on ugrad, where $ denotes
the command prompt, and user input is shown in **bold**. Note that the
first line shown below is the command you are expected to use as you
compile your program (and the one that will be used by the graders).
The compilation line should report zero errors and warnings, as
demonstrated below:

### Submission

Create a *.zip* file named *hw1.zip* which contains only **coins.c**
and **gitlog.txt**. (Do not zip your entire hw1 folder - only these two
files.) Copy the *hw1.zip* file to your local machine and submit it as
Homework 1 on Gradescope.

Recall you can create your `gitlog.txt` file by running `git log > gitlog.txt`.

When you submit, Gradescope conducts a series of automatic tests.
These tests do basic checks like making sure that you submitted the
right files and that your `.c` file compiles properly.  If you see error
messages here (look for red), address them and resubmit.

You should also make sure that your code has good
style. In brief, you should make sure that your submission is well formed:

- it is not overcommented or undercommented
- there are no ambiguous variable names 
- proper/consistent bracket placements and indentation
- no global variables

Two notes regarding automatic checks for programming assignments:

* Passing an automatic check is not itself worth points. (There
  might be a nominal, low point value like 0.01 associated with a check,
  but that will not count in the end.) The checks exist to help you and
  the graders find obvious errors. This will be true for most of the
  assignments; the actual grades are given manually by the graders, along
  with comments.
* The automatic checks cover some of the requirements set out in the
  assignment, but not all. There will be hidden tests that test edge
  cases. In general, it is up to you to test your own work and ensure
  your programs satisfy all stated requirements. Passing all the automatic
  checks does not necessarily mean you will earn all the points.
