Welcome to the website for Intermediate Programming (Fall 2024) at
<a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>!

*Course description*: This course teaches intermediate to advanced
programming, using C and C++. (Prior knowledge of these languages is not
expected.) We will cover low-level programming techniques, as well as
object-oriented class design, and the use of class libraries. Specific
topics include pointers, dynamic memory allocation, polymorphism,
overloading, inheritance, templates, collections, exceptions, and others
as time permits. Students are expected to learn syntax and some language
specific features independently. Course work involves significant
programming projects in both languages.

All public information about the course (assignments, exercises, etc.) will
be posted on this website.

Use the links at the top of the page to navigate the site.
