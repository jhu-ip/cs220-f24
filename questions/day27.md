title: Day 27 Recap Questions
reference solutions:
  1. When the relative functionality is part of the object
  2. A public field/member can be accessed freely by any code with access to the class definition. A private field/member can only be accessed from other member functions in the class.
  3. private
  4. Cannot define member functions in a C struct. However, a C++ struct is like a C++ class but all members are default public, so it can have member functions.
  5. A member function that C++ calls when you declare a new variable
  6. Objects can be initialized, instead of having the default constructor called first and then having the value reset.

1. What is object-oriented programming?
2. What is the difference between a public and a private field/member function?
3. Do class fields and member functions default to public or private?
4. Can we define member functions in a struct in C? How does C++ handle structs? Can we do that in C++?
5. What is a default constructor?
6. Why is using an initializer list in a class constructor a better choice than not using one?
