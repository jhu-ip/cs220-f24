title: Day 37 Recap Questions
reference solutions:
  1. Iterators unify the manner in which we step through the elements in a container.
  2. Inequality, dereference, and preincrement
  3. When data is not stored sequentially in memory
  4. As a nested class of the container
  5. Define `begin` and `end` member functions
  6. You won't be able to iterate over a const object of that container class.

1. Why use iterators?
2. What are the bare minimum operators that need to be overloaded by an iterator?
3. When won't a simple pointer correctly iterate through a collection?
4. Given a container class, how/where should its iterator class be specified?
5. In addition to defining the iterator class, what else should the container do to support iterators?
6. What might go wrong if we don't also define a const_iterator for a container?
