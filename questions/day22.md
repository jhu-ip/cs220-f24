title: Day 22 Recap Questions
reference solutions:
  1. C++ has classes, templates, STL, more convenient text input & output
  2. A way to differentiate items with the same names without confusion/shadowing
  3. Every source file that includes the header will then "use" the namespace.
  4. "std::cout <<" and "std::cin >>"
  5. C++ strings don't have null terminators, do have their own type. Don't have to worry about memory (allocation, reallocation, or deallocation). Supports operators like assignment, concatenation, and comparison.
  6. As long as it needs to be (and the heap can support it).

3. Why should you not put "using" statements in header files?
4. How do you read and write in C++ (i.e. standard inputting/outputting)?
5. What is the difference between C strings and C++ strings?
6. How long can a C++ string be?
