Create a Github account and provide us with the user name:

1. Create a free account at <a href="https://github.com/join">Github</a>, if you do not have one already.

2. Once created, fill in <a href="https://forms.gle/otwzfQguG19PcBa68" target="_blank">this form</a> **as soon as possible**.

3. Look out for an invitation email from Github in the mailbox of the email address you used to sign up for Github. Accept the invitation to join the course Github organization.

<p>If you do not accept the invitation, you will not be able to access the starter codes and we will not be able to provision you a private repository that you will need for the remainder of the course. Once you accept the invitation, you will be given a private repo under jhu-ip organization which you will use as your personal space for the exercises and homeworks throughout the semester.</p>
