**Syllabus**\
**Computer Science EN.601.220**\
**Intermediate Programming**\
**Fall 2024 (4 credits, E, in person)**

*(The instructors reserve the right to make adjustments to this
syllabus as deemed necessary with notice.)*

**Course Description**

-   This course teaches intermediate to advanced programming, using C
    and C++. (Prior knowledge of these languages is not expected, but
    prior programming experience and a general understanding of basic
    object-oriented programming are expected.) We will cover low-level
    programming techniques, as well as object-oriented class design, and
    the use of class libraries. Specific topics include pointers,
    dynamic memory allocation, polymorphism, overloading, inheritance,
    templates, collections, exceptions, and others as time permits.
    Students are expected to learn the syntax and some language-specific
    features independently. Course work involves significant programming
    projects in both languages.

-   **Prerequisites**\
    C+ grade or better in Gateway Computing (AP CS, EN.500.112/113/114/132/133/134, or
    equivalent)\
    Students are expected to be able to create and run simple programs
    and object-oriented solutions in a general-purpose programming
    language (such as Java or Python) prior to enrolling in this course.

-   **Required, Elective or Selective Elective**\
    Required course for computer science majors and minors.

**General Course Philosophy**

This course will focus more on learning than on assessment. While we
will use grades to let you know how you are doing, we hope that your
goal is learning the material, rather than "getting a good grade." In
the end, the best way to get a good grade is to develop an interest in
learning and engage with the material in a self-directed fashion.
Besides, in the long run, the knowledge and skills you acquire are far
more important than the grade is.

That said, be aware that the main difficulty many students have with
this course is **time management**. It will be a lot of work, and if you
don't budget your time well, you may find yourself with a grade that
does not reflect how well you understand the material. Additionally,
while there are lots of resources provided to help you succeed, we
cannot force you to use them; it is important to avail yourself of these
resources, particularly office hours.

**Course Approach**

We take a flipped classroom approach to the course,
with an emphasis on active learning during class sessions. Part of your
homework will be to prepare for class by watching video lessons. During
class sessions you will extend your learning by working with your
instructors and classmates to discuss new concepts and apply them to
in-class exercises, rather than listening to a lecture.

**Expectations & Grading**

All students are generally expected to actively participate in the
scheduled sessions of this course by answering and asking questions and
solving the learning exercises. You are also expected to learn via the
posted material, assignments, and projects. Our class time will include
a recap of the new material, discussion on the important concepts,
review of previous exercises, and live coding exercises. Before each
session, students are expected to go through the related material posted
on the course website and/or Piazza, and finish the coding exercises
from the prior session.

Students will be expected to complete a variety of computer
programming assignments, as well as written homework assignments. Some
assignments may be done in pairs or groups as specified; others must
be completed individually, with assistance as needed from course staff
only. See the specific assignment page for details of what is
permitted for a particular assignment. Failure to follow these
guidelines will be a violation of the academic ethics code, and
reported and penalized accordingly.

While code reuse is an important feature of modern programming, for
this course, you will be expected to write most of the code for your
homework assignments from scratch. You may use language libraries
(according to assignment specifications), and you may always reuse
your own code from prior work in the course. Downloading full or
partial solutions from the internet (including chatGPT or similar
AI-assisted coding tools), however, is an **ethics violation**. Using
code from class examples, slides, or the textbook is acceptable, but
you must cite the source properly in a comment in your code describing
the original source.

There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. The midterm exam will
cover the topics of the first half of the class (C material) and the
final exam will focus on the second half (C++ material). The exams are
designed to assess your knowledge of programming in C and C++ as well as
your problem solving ability, but not your knowledge of specific tools
or technologies discussed in class.

Homework assignments are expected to take a considerable amount of time;
start early and budget your time well. On average, it may take 5-15
hours per week, depending on the assignment and your approach.
Additionally, try to use incremental development so that even if you run
out of time, you can still turn in code that implements some of the
desired functionality (with a README file and comments explaining what's
missing). Keep in mind that half the features working all the way will
get you a lot more partial credit than all the features half-way
working. Good use of the version control system will significantly help
with your incremental development. For each commit, you should update
your README file to outline what's missing and what's done, and try to
keep each commit a submittable version. This is a good practice, and can
come in very handy in case you accidentally delete the local copy of
your homework!

Students are expected to learn material outside of class time and
homework, as well. We will generally provide links to tutorials,
references, and other resources for each topic. Students are expected to
read these, as well as seek out other resources on their own to further
their understanding of topics. There is a wealth of programming
information on the internet; if one explanation doesn't make sense, you
can probably find another that does.

**Homework submission policy**

Assignments will be due **by 11:00 pm on the due date** (unless
otherwise indicated on the course Piazza site). Non-compiling code will
earn a score of zero, so students are strongly encouraged to
double-check that all submitted code fully compiles with no errors or
warnings in the standard course compilation environment. We will
accommodate late submissions in several specific ways:

- Each student will be permitted to use up to 6 "late days" total
    during the semester on the individual assignments only. However,
    at most 2 late days may be used on any one assignment.

-   No late days are allowed for partner-based
    coding projects (midterm and final).

-   Each delay of up to 24 hours past the 11:00 pm deadline for an
    individual assignment counts as one late day.

-   Students do not need to ask permission or notify us when using any
    late days; deductions will be automatically taken since your final
    homework submission will be the one graded.

-   If you submit an assignment late and are out of late days (have used
    all 6 previously), you will be deducted 1% of the possible
    assignment points per hour (or fraction) that it is submitted
    late. For example, if you have no late days and submit an
    assignment 75 minutes late, you will lose 2% of the possible
    assignment points off the top.

Given these policies, please plan to get your homework done and turned
in early so that if you encounter any last-minute delays, it will not
hurt you too badly. Additionally, Gradescope will allow multiple
submission attempts; we will simply grade the last one. So it's a good
idea to develop your program incrementally, and turn in a
fully-compiling (if only partially complete) version every day or so.

Deadline exceptions can only be made by an instructor (not TAs/CAs), and
will only be considered in the circumstances outside the control of the
student (e.g., serious illness, death of a relative, etc.). If you must
request an exception, do so as early as possible; it is easier to get an
exception if you ask before an assignment is due, rather than after. No
exceptions will be given for failure to plan ahead or simply having
"too much work."

**In-class Exercises**

Many of the course topics will be supported by an exercise. Although
these exercises do not count towards your course grade, they are a very
important part of your learning, and as such we *strongly* recommend
that you complete them fully. We will review the solutions to these
exercises either fully or just the important parts in class sessions. In
general, we will *not* post solutions to the in-class exercises --- if
you are having trouble completing an exercise, seek help in office hours,
or on Piazza. We will have an option for you to submit your solutions on
gradescope and get autograder feedback on them.

**Code Reviews (Optional)**

Students can benefit from close review of their code in discussion
with a course instructor. You have the option to schedule one or more
reviews of your individual coding assignments with a course
instructor. These will typically take 30-45 minutes each, and
successful completion of code reviews for 2 different assignments will
result in a 100% "fudge" grade. "Successful completion" is based on
your ability to explain your code to the instructor and answer what-if
questions about it. Each code review must take place within the three
weeks immediately following that homework's due date.

**Fudge Grade**

Students typically do better in some aspects of the course than
others. The "fudge grade" is a percentage of your final grade that
duplicates your best performance from the individual grade categories listed below 
or the optional code reviews, but not group projects. For example, if you
successfully complete 2 code reviews, then your fudge grade will
contribute a full 3 points to your final grade. If you don't have 2
successful code reviews, but your highest individual grade category is
90% in written homework, then your fudge grade will contribute 2.7
points towards your final grade.

**Grading Breakdown**

-   5% - particpation (physical attendance and active participation)
    - <emph>You must attend 85% of the classes to receive full attendance credit (i.e., your attendance/participation percentage will be divided by 0.85 and then capped at 100%.) </emph>
-   6% - written homework (3 total; due dates vary; will be posted on Canvas)

-   28% - individual coding homework (5 total; point values and due dates vary; will be
    listed on Canvas)

-   14% - midterm coding project (in teams, due October 23)

-   15% - midterm exam (in class, Monday October 14)

-   14% - final coding project (in teams, due December 6)

-   15% - final exam (Tuesday Dec 17th, 2-5p)

-   3% - fudge grade (see above)

All scores and grader commentary on your homework and project
submissions, as well as exams, will be available via Gradescope. Please
keep your own record of your grades so that you will know your standing
in the course. At the end of the term, letter grades are generally
assigned according to the following scale. You should not expect a curve
in this course.

Interval | Letter grade
:------: | :----------:
\[97,100\] | A+
\[93,97\) | A
\[90,93\) | A-
\[87, 90\) | B+
\[83,87\) | B
\[80,83\) | B-
\[77, 80\) | C+
\[73,77\) | C
\[70,73\) | C-
\[67, 70\) | D+
\[60,67\) | D
\[0,60\) | F


**Ethics**

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal
integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful, abiding by
the *Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy*:

> Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic
> integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The
> university will punish cheaters with failure on an assignment,
> failure in a course, permanent transcript notation, suspension, and/or
> expulsion. Offenses may be reported to medical, law or other professional
> or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
> 
> Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments
> without permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices,
> unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery
> and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair
> competition. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.
> 
Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and programming  assignments without the help of others. For example, you must not look at anyone else’s solutions (including program code) to your homework problems. This includes AI tools such as, but not limited to, ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. You may also not seek out solutions from coursework or examinations from previous semesters nor make these solutions available to others. However, you may discuss assignment specifications (not solutions) with others to be sure you understand what is required by the assignment.
> 
> If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside
> sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly
> cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your
> group projects must list everyone who participated.
> 
> Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
> 
> Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular
> assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not
> sure what is permissible. (2) Seek help from the instructor, TA or CAs,
> as you are always encouraged to do, rather than from other students. (3)
> Cite any questionable sources of help you may have received.
> 
> On every exam, you will sign the following pledge: "I agree to complete
> this exam without unauthorized assistance from any person, materials or
> device. [Signed and dated]". Your course instructors will let you know
> where to find copies of old exams, if they are available.

**Disability Services**

Johns Hopkins University values diversity and inclusion. We are
committed to providing welcoming, equitable, and accessible
educational experiences for all students. Students with disabilities
(including those with psychological conditions, medical conditions,
and temporary disabilities) can request accommodations for this course
by providing an Accommodation Letter issued by Student Disability
Services (SDS). Please request accommodations for this course as early
as possible to provide time for effective communication and
arrangements.

For further information or to start the process of requesting
accommodations, please contact Student Disability Services at Homewood
Campus, Shaffer Hall #101, call: 410-516-4720 and email:
studentdisabilityservices@jhu.edu or visit the SDS website
<https://sds.jhu.edu/>.

**Inclusivity**

Johns Hopkins University is committed to creating a classroom
environment that values the diversity of experiences and perspectives
that all students bring. Everyone here has the right to be treated
with dignity and respect. Fostering an inclusive climate is important
because research and experience show that students who interact with
peers who are different from themselves learn new things and
experience tangible educational outcomes. Please participate in
creating a welcoming and vibrant classroom climate. Note that you
should expect to be challenged intellectually by the instructor, the
TAs, and your peers, and at times this may feel uncomfortable. Indeed,
it can be helpful to be pushed sometimes in order to learn and
grow. But at no time in this learning process should someone be
singled out or treated unequally on the basis of any seen or unseen
part of their identity.

If you ever have concerns in this course about harassment,
discrimination, or any unequal treatment, or if you seek
accommodations or resources, please reach out to your instructor or
the Tas, who will take your communication seriously and seek mutually
acceptable resolutions and accommodations. Reporting will never impact
your course grade. You may also share concerns with the department
chair, the Director of Undergraduate Studies [link to heads/DUS
document], the WSE Associate Dean of Outreach and Belonging (Darlene
Saporu, dsaporu@jhu.edu), the KSAS Assistant Dean for Diversity and
Inclusion (Araceli Frias, afrias3@jhu.edu) or the Office of
Institutional Equity (oie@jhu.edu).

In handling reports, people will protect your privacy as much as
possible, but faculty and staff are required to officially report
information for some cases (e.g., sexual harassment).

*Family accommodation policy:* You are welcome to bring a family member
to class on occasional days when your responsibilities require it (for
example, if emergency childcare is unavailable, or for the health
needs of a relative). In fact, you may see my children in class on
days when their school is closed. Please be sensitive to the classroom
environment, and if your family member becomes uncomfortably
disruptive, you may leave the classroom and return as needed.


**Deadlines for Adding, Dropping and Withdrawing from Courses**
