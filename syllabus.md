**Syllabus**\
**Computer Science EN.601.220**\
**Intermediate Programming**\
**Spring 2024 (4 credits, E, in person)**

*(The instructors reserve the right to make adjustments to this
syllabus as deemed necessary with notice.)*

**Course Description**

-   This course teaches intermediate to advanced programming, using C
    and C++. (Prior knowledge of these languages is not expected, but
    prior programming experience and a general understanding of basic
    object-oriented programming are expected.) We will cover low-level
    programming techniques, as well as object-oriented class design, and
    the use of class libraries. Specific topics include pointers,
    dynamic memory allocation, polymorphism, overloading, inheritance,
    templates, collections, exceptions, and others as time permits.
    Students are expected to learn the syntax and some language-specific
    features independently. Course work involves significant programming
    projects in both languages.

-   **Prerequisites**\
    Gateway Computing (AP CS, EN.500.112/113/114/132/133/134, or
    equivalent)\
    Students are expected to be able to create and run simple programs
    and object-oriented solutions in a general-purpose programming
    language (such as Java or Python) prior to enrolling in this course.

**General Course Philosophy**

This course will focus more on learning than on assessment. While we
will use grades to let you know how you are doing, we hope that your
goal is learning the material, rather than "getting a good grade." In
the end, the best way to get a good grade is to develop an interest in
learning and engage with the material in a self-directed fashion.
Besides, in the long run, the knowledge and skills you acquire are far
more important than the grade is.

That said, be aware that the main difficulty many students have with
this course is **time management**. It will be a lot of work, and if you
don't budget your time well, you may find yourself with a grade that
does not reflect how well you understand the material. Additionally,
while there are lots of resources provided to help you succeed, we
cannot force you to use them; it is important to avail yourself of these
resources, particularly office hours.

**Course Approach**

We take a flipped-classroom approach to the course,
with an emphasis on active learning during class sessions. Part of your
homework will be to prepare for class by watching video lessons. During
class sessions you will extend your learning by working with your
instructors and classmates to discuss new concepts and apply them to
in-class exercises, rather than listening to a lecture.

**Expectations & Grading**

All students are generally expected to actively participate in the
scheduled sessions of this course by answering and asking questions and
solving the learning exercises. You are also expected to learn via the
posted material, assignments, and projects. Our class time will include
a recap of the new material, discussion on the important concepts,
review of previous exercises, and live coding exercises. Before each
session, students are expected to go through the related material posted
on the course website and/or Piazza, and finish the coding exercises
from the prior session.

Students will be expected to complete a variety of computer programming
assignments, as well as written homework assignments. Some assignments
may be done in pairs or groups as specified; others must be completed
alone. See the specific assignment page for details of what is permitted
for a particular assignment. Failure to follow these guidelines will be
a violation of the academic ethics code, and reported and penalized
accordingly.

While code reuse is an important feature of modern programming, for this
course, you will be expected to write most of the code for your homework
assignments from scratch. You may use language libraries (according to
assignment specifications), and you may always reuse your own code from
prior work in the course. Downloading full or partial solutions from the
internet, however, is an **ethics violation**. Using code from class
examples, slides, or the textbook is acceptable, but you must cite the
source properly in a comment in your code describing the original
source.

There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. The midterm exam will
cover the topics of the first half of the class (C material) and the
final exam will focus on the second half (C++ material). The exams are
designed to assess your knowledge of programming in C and C++ as well as
your problem solving ability, but not your knowledge of specific tools
or technologies discussed in class.

Homework assignments are expected to take a considerable amount of time;
start early and budget your time well. On average, it may take 5-15
hours per week, depending on the assignment and your approach.
Additionally, try to use incremental development so that even if you run
out of time, you can still turn in code that implements some of the
desired functionality (with a README file and comments explaining what's
missing). Keep in mind that half the features working all the way will
get you a lot more partial credit than all the features half-way
working. Good use of the version control system will significantly help
with your incremental development. For each commit, you should update
your README file to outline what's missing and what's done, and try to
keep each commit a submittable version. This is a good practice, and can
come in very handy in case you accidentally delete the local copy of
your homework!

Students are expected to learn material outside of class time and
homework, as well. We will generally provide links to tutorials,
references, and other resources for each topic. Students are expected to
read these, as well as seek out other resources on their own to further
their understanding of topics. There is a wealth of programming
information on the internet; if one explanation doesn't make sense, you
can probably find another that does.

**Homework policy**

Assignments will be due **by 11:00 pm on the due date** (unless
otherwise indicated on the course Piazza site). Non-compiling code will
earn a score of zero, so students are strongly encouraged to
double-check that all submitted code fully compiles with no errors or
warnings in the standard course compilation environment. We will
accommodate late submissions in several specific ways:

-   There will be a 30-minute grace period after the deadline during
    which assignments can still be submitted, but will receive a penalty
    of a deduction of 10% of the points possible on the assignment.

-   Each student will be permitted to use up to 4 "late days" total
    during the semester on the individual coding assignments only.
    However, at most 2 late days may be used on any one assignment.

-   Each delay of up to 24 hours past the 11:00 pm deadline for an
    individual coding assignment counts as one late day.

-   No late days are allowed for handwritten homework or partner-based
    coding projects.

-   Students may not use a grace period with a late day. For example, if
    Student A turns in her homework at 11:45 pm on the day it is due
    (only 45 minutes past the original deadline), then she will be using
    one late day. Furthermore, if Student B turns in his homework at
    11:15 pm on the day after it is due, he'll be using two late days.

Given these policies, please plan to get your homework done and turned
in early so that if you encounter any last-minute delays, it will not
hurt you too badly. Additionally, Gradescope will allow multiple
submission attempts; we will simply grade the last one. So it's a good
idea to develop your program incrementally, and turn in a
fully-compiling (if only partially complete) version every day or so.

Deadline exceptions can only be made by an instructor (not TAs/CAs), and
will only be considered in the circumstances outside the control of the
student (e.g., serious illness, death of a relative, etc.). If you must
request an exception, do so as early as possible; it is easier to get an
exception if you ask before an assignment is due, rather than after. No
exceptions will be given for failure to plan ahead or simply having
"too much work."

**In-class Exercises**

Many of the course topics will be supported by an exercise. Although
these exercises do not count towards your course grade, they are a very
important part of your learning, and as such we *strongly* recommend
that you complete them fully. We will review the solutions to these
exercises either fully or just the important parts in class sessions. In
general, we will *not* post solutions to the in-class exercises --- if
you are having trouble completing an exercise, seek help office hours,
or on Piazza. We will have an option for you to submit your solutions on
gradescope and get autograder feedback on them.

**Grading Breakdown**

-   5% - Particpation (physical attendance and active participation)
    - <emph>You must attend 85% of the classes to receive full attendance credit (i.e., your attendance/participation percentage will be divided by 0.85 and then capped at 100%.) </emph>
-   6% - handwritten homework (3 total; due dates vary, will be listed
    on Piazza)

-   30% - individual coding homework (4.5 total; due dates vary, will be
    listed on Piazza)

-   14% - midterm coding project (in teams)

-   15% - midterm exam (in class, Friday March 8th)

-   15% - final coding project (in teams)

-   15% - final exam

All scores and grader commentary on your homework and project
submissions, as well as exams, will be available via Gradescope. Please
keep your own record of your grades so that you will know your standing
in the course. At the end of the term, letter grades are generally
assigned according to the following scale. You should not expect a curve
in this course.

Interval | Letter grade
:------: | :----------:
\[97,100\] | A+
\[93,97\) | A
\[90,93\) | A-
\[87, 90\) | B+
\[83,87\) | B
\[80,83\) | B-
\[77, 80\) | C+
\[73,77\) | C
\[70,73\) | C-
\[67, 70\) | D+
\[60,67\) | D
\[0,60\) | F


**Ethics**

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal
integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful, abiding by
the *Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy*:

> Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic
> integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The
> university will punish cheaters with failure on an assignment,
> failure in a course, permanent transcript notation, suspension, and/or
> expulsion. Offenses may be reported to medical, law or other professional
> or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
> 
> Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments
> without permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices,
> unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery
> and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair
> competition. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.
> 
Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and programming  assignments without the help of others. For example, you must not look at anyone else’s solutions (including program code) to your homework problems. This includes AI tools such as, but not limited to, ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. You may also not seek out solutions from coursework or examinations from previous semesters nor make these solutions available to others. However, you may discuss assignment specifications (not solutions) with others to be sure you understand what is required by the assignment.
> 
> If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside
> sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly
> cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your
> group projects must list everyone who participated.
> 
> Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
> 
> Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular
> assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not

**Classroom Climate**

As your instructor, I am committed to creating a classroom environment
that values the diversity of experiences and perspectives that all
students bring. Everyone here has the right to be treated with dignity
and respect. I believe fostering an inclusive climate is important
because research and my experience show that students who interact
with peers who are different from themselves learn new things and
experience tangible educational outcomes. Please join me in creating a
welcoming and vibrant classroom climate. Note that you should expect
to be challenged intellectually by me, the TAs, and your peers, and
at times this may feel uncomfortable. Indeed, it can be helpful to be
pushed sometimes in order to learn and grow. But at no time in this
learning process should someone be singled out or treated unequally on
the basis of any seen or unseen part of their identity.

If you ever have concerns in this course about
harassment, discrimination, or any unequal treatment, or if you seek
accommodations or resources, I invite you to share directly with me or
the TAs. I promise that we will take your communication seriously and
to seek mutually acceptable resolutions and accommodations. Reporting
will never impact your course grade. You may also share concerns
with the department/center chair/head/director (Randal Burns, [randal@cs.jhu.edu](mailto:randal@cs.jhu.edu)),
the Director of Undergraduate Studies (Joanne Selinski, [joanne@cs.jhu.edu](mailto:joanne@cs.jhu.edu)),
the Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion (Darlene Saporu, [dsaporu@jhu.edu](mailto:dsaporu@jhu.edu)),
or the Office of Institutional Equity ([oie@jhu.edu](mailto:oie@jhu.edu)).
In handling reports, people will protect your privacy
as much as possible, but faculty and staff are required to
officially report information for some cases (e.g. sexual harassment).

**Family Accommodations Policy**

You are welcome to bring a family member to class on occasional days
when your responsibilities require it (for example, if emergency child
care is unavailable, or for health needs of a relative).  In fact,
you may see my children in class on days when their school is closed. 
Please be sensitive to the classroom environment, and if your family
member becomes uncomfortably disruptive, you may leave the classroom
and return as needed.

**University Policy on Incompletes**

There are important revisions to the Incomplete Grade policy in effect
for **UNDERGRADUATES** for the 2022-2023 academic year. The full policy is
available here: <https://e-catalogue.jhu.edu/engineering/full-time-residential-programs/undergraduate-policies/academic-policies/grading-policies/>

The following text is an excerpt:  

> 1. *A request for an Incomplete grade must be initiated by the student
>    no later than the last day of classes via the Incomplete Grade Contract
>    available in SIS*
> 2. *The required elements on the Incomplete Grade Contract are listed
>    below; all of these topics should be included in the conversation between
>    the student and the instructor.*
>   * *The reason for the request for an incomplete grade*
>   * *A description of all outstanding work that must be completed*
>   * *Date the work is due from the student*
>   * *The reversion grade if the student does not complete any of the outstanding work*
> 3. *Instructors are required to submit the new grade to the Office of
>    the Homewood Registrar no later than 45 calendar days after the last day
>    of classes. If the Incomplete grade is not resolved within 45 calendar
>    days after the last day of classes, the Incomplete grade is automatically
>    converted to the reversion grade.*
  

The significant change here is that there is an Incomplete Grade Contract
available to students in SIS to request an incomplete grade. This is how
all incomplete grades must be initiated now.  The other significant
change is the timeline for completion of an incomplete grade, now set at
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">45 calendar days after the last
day of classes</span></b>. Formerly, the default deadline was the end of the third week
of the following semester. See the full catalogue entry for considerations
for students on academic probation and graduating students.
